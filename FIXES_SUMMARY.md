# Audio Pipeline Critical Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Race Conditions ✅
- Added `asyncio.Lock()` to prevent concurrent processing
- Wrapped all audio processing in lock protection

### 2. Buffer Signature Logic ✅  
- Replaced flawed length-based signatures with SHA-256 content hashing
- Reliable duplicate detection based on actual audio content

### 3. Memory Leaks ✅
- Added buffer size limits (1 second max)
- Implemented sliding window approach

### 4. WebSocket Errors ✅
- Specific exception handling for connection issues
- Proper logging instead of silent failures

### 5. Timeout Protection ✅
- 30-second timeout for utterance processing
- Automatic cleanup on stuck operations

### 6. State Management ✅
- Unified processing decision logic
- Proper reset and cleanup methods

## Key Changes

- **Content-based deduplication** using SHA-256 hashing
- **Async locks** to prevent race conditions  
- **Buffer overflow protection** with automatic cleanup
- **Timeout mechanisms** for stuck processing
- **Improved error handling** with specific exception types

## Result

The repeated responses issue should now be completely resolved with:
- No duplicate audio processing
- Clean state transitions
- Memory leak prevention
- Better reliability and performance

Test by starting the backend server and using the voice assistant frontend.
